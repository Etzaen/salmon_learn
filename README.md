Salmon Learn 3 
====
Salmon Learn is a tool created by [GungeeSpla](https://github.com/GungeeSpla) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/GungeeSpla)) to help teach people how more complex mechanics of Salmon Run in Splatoon 2.

This is a fork aimed at updating it to Salmon Run New Wave, as seen in Splatoon 3. When I started working on this, Gungee had not yet announced [Salmon Learn NW](https://salmon-learn-nw.gungee.jp/), which is superior in many ways, but I am choosing to still leave this up.

## Differences

Besides support for the new maps seen in Splatoon 3, some inaccuracies in the map topography were observed, and updated with newer versions from Gungee's other projects. Inaccurate values for enemy sight and weapon ranges were also corrected to match the in-game values more closely. New enemies and weapons have also been added.

(Some Grizzco weapons may not yet have accurate range data.)
